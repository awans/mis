jealousy is a crazy thing huh? i would aspire to be a better person so you are not so overcome that you do disgusting shameful mean nasty vulgar things like this. that is how you will get ahead in this world. karma is a real bitch. i bet you felt so inadecequate, as you betrayed your friend, and pretended to be me online. what an impressive person you are? i would be soooo proud to be you if i were you. everyone should aspire to be like aysha and tanya the 2 people with all these #awesomepeopleproblems too cool for school, so cool, they 2 face friends, and in turn took that info and passed it along to others, and then, because you are such a stellar wonderful person that we should all look up to, you created an account on CL and pretended to be me, wow tanya you are just really amazing, aysha, way to go, with those #awesomepeopleproblems<br>
<br>
AND since you ladies are just so #awsome with all your #peopleproblems you had enough time on your hands to pretend to be me on the internets, and you ladies are just so freaking rad you had enough time to send me fake emails all night long any number of times, as a different person. man, i really admire you guys. i could have never thought of something so freaking cool. oh no, i just built my own electric scooter, i could never ever ever think of this, i admire your intelligence and coolness since you have such little time on your hands being so cool for us all. <br>
<br>
you two are SO successful too! and all the girls want you because you are sooo hot, LOL.<br>
<br>
gosh, if my crazy ass could only JUST BE LIKE YOU AyshA AND TANYA. I WOULD BE SUCH A COOL HIP PERSON. and you are so awesome you don't have time to walk past my place, oh no everyone in the city wants to be around you 2, you are the definition of what everyone in SF aspires to be. gosh, how can i possibly be graced with your presence in this bar you ladies worked at for such a long time, being cool for all the new lesbians, by doing things like the above. 'this how we do' tanya says as she sips her 40 and lets out ANOTHER wet fart, as aysha scratches her crusty ass and flakes fly.<br>
i am just so taken back by how cool you two are, geez if i could only be like you. <br>
<br>
this is how you treat your 'friends' of HOW MANY YEARS? what do you girls do to your enemies?<br>
<br>
let me give you a glimpse of ayshas personality, if it were someone she was kissing ass to in whatever scene she is adapting her non existent personality to, she would not do it to them, it might tarnish her imagined reputation. but to a friend, of over 5 years she is ready to go. what a nasty nasty girl who would want you aysha? nobody. <br>
<br>
you are really gross people. i feel very sorry for you. i would never ever ever do that to someone, not something like this. i hate you for it.<br>
