we were in green apple. you had long dark hair and glasses, I was making a snide remark to a friend of mine about how 1984 really should have been remade into a romantic comedy by now, and you interjected perhaps it has been, and we're simply too immersed in the modern day fuckery of civilization to notice. we ended up talking first about what we'd do in a Road Warrior-esque american apocalypse, and then about what we ACTUALLY did. you were a programmer, of course, and I am a deadbeat essayist. you asked if you could read some of my work, and I said sure. <br>
<br>
when I wrote down your email I didn't figure for the rain. the cursed rain. the note in my pocket ran like a cheap metaphor and I thought "dammit, now what to do". my options were to hire a private investigator (expensive), wander around green apple (I already do that), or write a craigslist missed connection (which seems appropriately cliche). I say to myself, what's to become of this; missed connections is about as effective as firing a shotgun into a crowd of pigeons and hoping you get some KFC out of it, and often gawked by people looking for the clown shoes train wrecks of loneliness that naturally inhabit any large city. perhaps you won't read this, sardonic girl, but perhaps someone else will. perhaps Big Brother's sexy sibling, Mistress Observation. on second thought, that sounds like some sort of BDSM thing, and that's not my cup of joseph. <br>
<br>
anyway, needless tangential meanderings aside, it would be nice to talk to you again. even if most likely the only respondants to this will be porn spam offering to engorge my member. everyone's member needs a little engorgement every now and again. <br>
