If the rain ever stops, it will be a miracle.  If the time ever comes, it will be a miracle.  It is drudgery.  Drudgery cloaked in happiness.  Drudgery is the foundation, laid out long before, even before before.  Pulling myself out of bed and drudging down to the garden so the dog can sniff every plant known to man, and perhaps lift his leg on something that doesn't yet have his scent. If that's possible.  Perhaps squat.  Drudging back up the stairs.  Back to the dullness of work, the lifeless grey motivator.  There is not one splash of red or color or blue to make it worthwhile it seems.  Just waiting, with the silent ticking of the clock resounding in my head.  An entire lifetime to hurry up and wait.  Yoshi makes it bearable.  With his uncompromising value system, and his magic in the kitchen.  Bella likes him and they play games together, keeping her occupied.  Cory looks up to him for the work that he is accomplishing for the families of all those missing girls.  But still, drudgery sludging along in my mind, forcing a smile to Yoshi who is constantly seeking approval.  Careful to stay out of Katie's way, her way has become so bitter as of late.  Drew of course never around anymore.  Just always off doing his thing, or doing god knows who or what.  Drudgery waiting for people to do the right thing.  Micah curing the incurable.  Slowly shuffling to the kitchen to make something hot to drink.  Standing at the counter eyes in a glaze, sipping whatever it is I've made, not really tasting it.  Hallucinations that the phone rings.  I pick it up "Drew?" and of course there's no one there.  Just more hallucinations.  More by instinct than anything, the pop of the shower and the freezing cold water hits my skin like a block of ice.  Wake up, snap out of it.  It's been years.  Nothing.  Eventually it turns to warm then hot and my skin is scalded.  Wake up, snap out of it.  It's been years.  Still nothing.  Not caring about what I wear.  Just pull on any old thing.  The pattering of the rain on the window is a slow drip reminiscent of torture remedies for insurgent spies.  The drip drip drip on the forehead, the head in a position that cannot move or turn.  Just the drip drip drip and with each droplet insanity creeps in a little more.  Which scent today?  Rose? Orange? Ginger.  Who cares.  Yoshi is babbling about coffee from Italy, baguettes from France.  Seems a long way to have to go.  But Bella seems delighted and that's all that matters.  Slumping on the side of the bed, glancing myself in the mirror.  The hair washed but unkept.  The body clean and smelling nice but never touched.  If the rain ever stops it will be a miracle.  <!-- START CLTAGS -->
