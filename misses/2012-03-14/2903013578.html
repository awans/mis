I feel as I'm haunted by the fond memories of a beautiful stranger.  <br>
<br>
An image of such radiance that would only burn the pages of the book, if I had to write a story about her.<br>
<br>
It began a long time ago, with the awkward passing glances that I'd foolishly attempt to hide.  A unique hair color, that must be natural because it's kept with her for all these years.  We used to get off on the same station, at the end of the line.  The same train takes us to where we spend our days toiling away to feed ourselves.  After we'd get off the train we always walk in different directions and somehow ended up running into each other again, like our paths to our work places were part of a huge pachinko machine with only one outcome.  It makes me realize that the financial district really isn't that big at all.  <br>
<br>
For some reason, she imprinted on my mind.  Her pale skin tone, that whimsical color of reddish golden hair, her sense of style.  She'd walk around with the most adorable smile I had ever seen.   Suddenly, and without the slightest damn thing that I could do about it, I'd feel good about things.  I could feel the birds chirping, and notice the brightness of sun's rays beating through the urban jungle of our harsh city.  The day would be inevitably better.  It was like a gift when I saw her.  Maybe because she idealized perfection in my mind's eye, and somewhere in my brain, activated the same neuro-chemicals that activate when you're given something that you really want.  Like the first gulp of ice cold beer with your friends after moving furniture all day in the hot sun.  She was the perfect height for my size.  The perfect body structure for my taste.  Oh and that face...  I know that it's cliche, to say in the least, but it was breathtaking.  Whenever I saw her I could feel a fluttering jolt, like a nervous unease of anticipation, and with it always came the unquenchable anger at myself of not being able to force myself to say "hello."<br>
<br>
And then the seasons changed.  I moved offices and I saw her no more... well barely.  I mean it is San Francisco after all and we live in the same residential district.  I saw her once as I was walking out of blockbuster on Sloat, as she was going in.  Another time I spotted that unmistakeable light orange reddish hair walking into Underdogs on a sunny Saturday morning, while I happen to standing in a building across the street.  I even sat next to her on the train once, while she talked on the phone and I was quietly listening to my music, staring out the window as I always do, never daring to eavesdrop.  All by chance.  And each time, I failed to act, knowing that I may never see her again.  Each time I fought myself, fighting my desire to have her in my life in any way, shape, or form and facing possibly ultimate rejection, essentially ending the bittersweet dream of what if's and could be's.   <br>
<br>
Years would pass, and I would still see her every once in a while.  Which I still do sometimes.  She started to go to the train station that I'm forced to go to now due to it's proximity to my office, or maybe she always did and I just never noticed.  Last week I saw her walk past the very doors to my newer office twice, once alone smiling to herself probably enjoying the beautiful weather and the second time with some guy, probably on a coffee date or something.  <br>
<br>
Over these years, I've been through a series of failed relationships with various charlatans and tricksters and almost went the distance with one of them.  Some of them were very attractive too, but it would always be the same unmistakeable feeling of angst and elation whenever I happened to catch a glimpse of this mysterious redheaded stranger.  And I think it always will.    <br>
<br>
I've posted on this site about her before.  Usually after I've seen her and there's too much churning inside, threatening to eat the very soul of me.  It's kind of like a catharsis for myself each time, spewing my longings on a unsuspecting sea of strangers, who will probably never know or meet me.  And even if they did, would they know that I post on this place.  Heck no.  LOL! I know I'm much too shy and proper to initiate a conversation with someone who's only there because she's trying to get home.  And she's so pretty, that I wouldn't be surprised if she has always had the pick of the litter and is used to the inane blabblings of random dude standing next to her on the train.  A dude that I refuse to be because I have not a single shred of stalker tendency in me.   Just a foolish heart and maybe a very very slight eidetic memory.    <br>
<br>
But isn't that the nature of this forum?  An anonymous place where we can vent out our frustrations at not getting the girl, not taking the chance, not destroying that idea of that beautiful stranger we happen to come across in our travels through a muddled world of muted emotion filled strangers?  <br>
<br>
I'd love to wander into her mind, explore her vibrance, share her musing, and feel her warmth.  To just sit with my arm around her as I trace the outlines of perfection that I see in her as she guides me through her perspectives of the world.  But maybe it's in here where she belongs.  A figment of my imagination.  A gift from the gods to remind me that beauty does exist in the world, whether it's a part of my life or it isn't.  And it will continue to flourish and captivate regardless of my existence.  <br>
<br>
The day ends and I look down the long narrow tube of the subway station.  Secretly, I'm hoping to catch a glimpse of that familiar hair just once more before I step onto my train.  She doesn't appear and I'm okay with it.  I sit down and close my eyes, turn my music up a little more, as the train carries me far far away from where I want to be.  <br>
<br>
She is my missed connection. <br>
