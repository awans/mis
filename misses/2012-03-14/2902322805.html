We were both in the front car on the outbound M leaving SFSU this afternoon around 1:25 pm. You were wearing a green sweater and have long curly (wavy? don't know the right term) black hair. You were also carrying a clear umbrella and had your nails painted black (saw your fingernails when you were messing with your phone on the train). I was the guy with the purple water bottle that had a beard. <br>
<br>
I have seen you around campus and on this same Muni quite a few times now and I keep meaning to say hi but for some reason I'm just too shy. I know we've exchanged smiles and looks before when we've seen eachother. I just think you're really pretty and like the way you 'carry yourself' if that makes any sense. I know we haven't ever spoken but I get the sense that you're a very confident person. Maybe that's what's keeping me from saying hello? Who knows. And I doubt you'll ever see this post, so hopefully next time I see you I can say hi. If for some odd reason you do see this I'd love to do something with you some time :) Maybe coffee?<!-- START CLTAGS -->
