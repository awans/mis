V\u000aYou're ok with having your existence annihilated?   When guys treat me like that I give them a swift kick in the balls so they have something to remember me by.  It's the very least they deserve.  You should have done that instead of celebrating the fact that he ignores you and gives you the cold shoulder and treats you as if you are invisible.  There's some kind of very base satisfaction with it.    I know it's not very ladylike.  But who gives a shit.  You already know he doesn't love you.  Now you want him to disrespect your existence too?   I'd rather walk away with my pride, and him respecting me for standing up for myself as he's clutching his nutsack.  \u000a\u000aThere's way too much emphasis put on love and not enough put on basic human respect and decency, which is diminishing more and more in our society.

V\u000aWhoa whoa whoa. \u000a\u000aAnd we wonder why there isn't a community. Instead of going to an event and saying hello to folks, going to a queer bar and introducing yourself, you'd rather just sit around and complain on craigslist that there isn't a community.  I have an awesome community in SF...it took me a few years to solidify it, but it's awesome and full of a lot of diverse folks from gender identity, age, race..etc.. \u000a\u000aWhat I'm hearing is that y'all are just lazy and want folks to come up to you and smile at you on the street- this is not Idaho, we live in a city where a smile could mean unwanted attention.  \u000a\u000aAnd all this noise about butches and femmes? really? is this 1975 are we still really having this conversation.   Femmes, like other human fucking beings, can be, whatever they want, with whomever they want. This boring misogyny is just upsetting.  Also, butch women, who want to have a masculine identity- don't want to be men, though, you know what, some female bodied masculine identified folks want to be seen as men, and THAT'S FINE.  WHY DOES IT MATTER.\u000a\u000aMaybe this sort of mind set is why no one talks to you people.. good lord. pick up a fucking queer theory book dated past 1981 and learn about your community before you damn them for not loving you.

V\u000aI skimmed over your response.\u000a\u000a a swift kick in the balls is still in order no matter if he is bipolar or not. (i say bipolar because it's the only explanation for his behavior toward you).  If you really want to have some fun, kick him in the balls and has he's crouched over in pain and he asks "Why did you do that?", deny you ever did it, play appalled that he would accuse you of such a thing, then tap his head and say he needs to get his head fixed and toss him the business card of a shrink.  \u000a\u000a\u000a

You were working alone and it was busy, I've asked you how your day was, you rolled your eyes and were pretty rude but I didn't care. I've sat at the bar and watched you work for a couple of hours. U became nicer as I kept coming back to get a refill. I was scared to make a move though. Then u went out to smoke a cigarette and I followed you, we talked for a couple of minutes, u told me u were moving to NY in two weeks, then you had to go back in. Never done this missed connections thing before, but I'm hoping u will see this so I can properly introduce myself before u leave SF.\u000aTony

V\u000aWe were both in the front car on the outbound M leaving SFSU this afternoon around 1:25 pm. You were wearing a green sweater and have long curly (wavy? don't know the right term) black hair. You were also carrying a clear umbrella and had your nails painted black (saw your fingernails when you were messing with your phone on the train). I was the guy with the purple water bottle that had a beard. \u000a\u000aI have seen you around campus and on this same Muni quite a few times now and I keep meaning to say hi but for some reason I'm just too shy. I know we've exchanged smiles and looks before when we've seen eachother. I just think you're really pretty and like the way you 'carry yourself' if that makes any sense. I know we haven't ever spoken but I get the sense that you're a very confident person. Maybe that's what's keeping me from saying hello? Who knows. And I doubt you'll ever see this post, so hopefully next time I see you I can say hi. If for some odd reason you do see this I'd love to do something with you some time :) Maybe coffee?

V\u000aThis seems trite, assumptive, uppity, and even if on an anonymous forum, entirely inappropriate.    It's a philosophy you assume all need to subscribe to, when not everyone needs that philosophy.  If someone doesn't want to be with someone, then they simply have to tell that person.  That's what I do, and it's worked out really well for me.  \u000a\u000aOn another note,  I have been in a relationship with the most generous, thoughtful, calming, endearing, powerful man.\u000a\u000aCheers

V\u000aI noticed you as soon as you got on the Muni (I think it was Church station). You ended up sitting right in front of me holding flowers and a box with beautiful long curly hair and big green eyes. I tried not to stare, but I couldn't help myself. I was wearing a blue hoodie with my headphones in and I think you had headphones in too (purple ones I believe). As soon as I got off I regretted not saying hi and introducing myself. This may be a long shot, but If those flowers weren't from a boyfriend, you want to get some coffee sometime?

You had straight hair, cut short-ish, light colored? It was hard to tell in the dim light. Myself: beard, cap, blue fleece-lined hoodie, black backpack, cowboy boots. Something about you struck me - you are handsome and interesting looking. If you like meeting new people, talking about politics, and good tequila, do drop a line.

V\u000aI feel as I'm haunted by the fond memories of a beautiful stranger.  \u000a\u000aAn image of such radiance that would only burn the pages of the book, if I had to write a story about her.\u000a\u000aIt began a long time ago, with the awkward passing glances that I'd foolishly attempt to hide.  A unique hair color, that must be natural because it's kept with her for all these years.  We used to get off on the same station, at the end of the line.  The same train takes us to where we spend our days toiling away to feed ourselves.  After we'd get off the train we always walk in different directions and somehow ended up running into each other again, like our paths to our work places were part of a huge pachinko machine with only one outcome.  It makes me realize that the financial district really isn't that big at all.  \u000a\u000aFor some reason, she imprinted on my mind.  Her pale skin tone, that whimsical color of reddish golden hair, her sense of style.  She'd walk around with the most adorable smile I had ever seen.   Suddenly, and without the slightest damn thing that I could do about it, I'd feel good about things.  I could feel the birds chirping, and notice the brightness of sun's rays beating through the urban jungle of our harsh city.  The day would be inevitably better.  It was like a gift when I saw her.  Maybe because she idealized perfection in my mind's eye, and somewhere in my brain, activated the same neuro-chemicals that activate when you're given something that you really want.  Like the first gulp of ice cold beer with your friends after moving furniture all day in the hot sun.  She was the perfect height for my size.  The perfect body structure for my taste.  Oh and that face...  I know that it's cliche, to say in the least, but it was breathtaking.  Whenever I saw her I could feel a fluttering jolt, like a nervous unease of anticipation, and with it always came the unquenchable anger at myself of not being able to force myself to say "hello."\u000a\u000aAnd then the seasons changed.  I moved offices and I saw her no more... well barely.  I mean it is San Francisco after all and we live in the same residential district.  I saw her once as I was walking out of blockbuster on Sloat, as she was going in.  Another time I spotted that unmistakeable light orange reddish hair walking into Underdogs on a sunny Saturday morning, while I happen to standing in a building across the street.  I even sat next to her on the train once, while she talked on the phone and I was quietly listening to my music, staring out the window as I always do, never daring to eavesdrop.  All by chance.  And each time, I failed to act, knowing that I may never see her again.  Each time I fought myself, fighting my desire to have her in my life in any way, shape, or form and facing possibly ultimate rejection, essentially ending the bittersweet dream of what if's and could be's.   \u000a\u000aYears would pass, and I would still see her every once in a while.  Which I still do sometimes.  She started to go to the train station that I'm forced to go to now due to it's proximity to my office, or maybe she always did and I just never noticed.  Last week I saw her walk past the very doors to my newer office twice, once alone smiling to herself probably enjoying the beautiful weather and the second time with some guy, probably on a coffee date or something.  \u000a\u000aOver these years, I've been through a series of failed relationships with various charlatans and tricksters and almost went the distance with one of them.  Some of them were very attractive too, but it would always be the same unmistakeable feeling of angst and elation whenever I happened to catch a glimpse of this mysterious redheaded stranger.  And I think it always will.    \u000a\u000aI've posted on this site about her before.  Usually after I've seen her and there's too much churning inside, threatening to eat the very soul of me.  It's kind of like a catharsis for myself each time, spewing my longings on a unsuspecting sea of strangers, who will probably never know or meet me.  And even if they did, would they know that I post on this place.  Heck no.  LOL! I know I'm much too shy and proper to initiate a conversation with someone who's only there because she's trying to get home.  And she's so pretty, that I wouldn't be surprised if she has always had the pick of the litter and is used to the inane blabblings of random dude standing next to her on the train.  A dude that I refuse to be because I have not a single shred of stalker tendency in me.   Just a foolish heart and maybe a very very slight eidetic memory.    \u000a\u000aBut isn't that the nature of this forum?  An anonymous place where we can vent out our frustrations at not getting the girl, not taking the chance, not destroying that idea of that beautiful stranger we happen to come across in our travels through a muddled world of muted emotion filled strangers?  \u000a\u000aI'd love to wander into her mind, explore her vibrance, share her musing, and feel her warmth.  To just sit with my arm around her as I trace the outlines of perfection that I see in her as she guides me through her perspectives of the world.  But maybe it's in here where she belongs.  A figment of my imagination.  A gift from the gods to remind me that beauty does exist in the world, whether it's a part of my life or it isn't.  And it will continue to flourish and captivate regardless of my existence.  \u000a\u000aThe day ends and I look down the long narrow tube of the subway station.  Secretly, I'm hoping to catch a glimpse of that familiar hair just once more before I step onto my train.  She doesn't appear and I'm okay with it.  I sit down and close my eyes, turn my music up a little more, as the train carries me far far away from where I want to be.  \u000a\u000aShe is my missed connection. \u000a\u000a

You waited for me at a corner starbucks and we went off to our hookah date. We had drinks, laughed, talked about our silliness and had lots of fun that night ;). I never have posted on here, but you my dear have been on my mind. Unfortunately, I no longer have your number (i've had many new phones since then!), I don't remember your last name for the life of me (so looking you up on fb is not an option).

V\u000aSaw you briefly at the gym again yesterday.  You always say hello and give me a warm smile.  I think this is a long shot since we are practically opposites (physically),  maybe you are just being friendly, but I think you are so hot. You have an amazing body and you seem very sweet as well!\u000aIf you think this is you and you would like to get to know me a little better let me know,otherwise, I will just continue to have nasty dreams about you. :)

V\u000aMatt, where did you go?  Sexy MWM with the big dick, hard as granite, sexy brown eyes, stocky muscular body, hairy chest.  I could literally ride you for hours.    Just sex, great sex, no complications.   You even liked to be tied up, while I worshiped your stud body and edged your trophy cock.  \u000a\u000aBut then you disappeared.  Argh.  Damn.  Come back to me...if only for an lunch session.  :)\u000a\u000aI miss you stud.  Goodluck.  You're a nice guy and have earned your swagger.

You were with a group of guys of similar build of yourself (and one chubby) but nowhere near as cute as you! You danced hard when the remix of the new Rihanna came on, and harder when they did a throwback Britney remix. You bumped into me, and spilled a little bit of your drink, but you didn't notice. \u000a\u000aI am 5'10, slim, with brown eyes, and hair. If you think this is you, it probably is! Please reply!

V\u000a"The Zen answer to what to do next is that real truth is in everyday life. This may well be so: in a universe where knowledge defeats us, what can we do but be what we are? We have to ask why it is that it matters that knowledge of the universe be moved into symbolic representation in our minds. The information we seek is in existence around us at all times, happening in the patterns we seek to understand and quantify. What good is there in this understanding? Clearly we are evolutionarily driven to this attempted understanding, but is there a better reason to be had?"\u000a\u000aProbably not:-) but Popper thought it was worth the effort. Well, that's my excuse- driven to move the universe into symbolic representation in my mind while truth lies outside the text.  Rather hopeless endeavor, but I've already reproduced so I've done my part and can now simply be eccentric- like playing pattern recognition games in the wild west internet.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aHello!\u000aI was kinda standing by you, a very cute lady in dark glasses and a white blouse. You were playing trivia, I was watching basketball with a bunch of people that were way more excited about basketball than I was. I think you were probably with a guy but Missed Connections is a total shot-in-the-dark anyways so why not?\u000aI was wearing a red sweater, also a blue shirt, also dark glasses, probably scratching a devilishy-handsome beard; I was also advised to stop looking your way. Did you see that semi-colon? Appropriately used! Bonus points?\u000aI like to write, read, draw, explore, play with my dog, and watch professional baseball and soccer. Do you like any of those things?

V\u000aso im writing this to let it go.  i need you out of my head! i want you gone! \u000ai like you far too much. because you came into my life at a crisis time too it makes it extra risky for me.  \u000ayou seem pretty stable despite things.  \u000aits not like i am that great at all! i know there are lots of other amazing women out there.\u000ai want to be there for you. \u000athis gets complicated bec im sure you are seeing other girls and i need it simple, thats another\u000areason why i need someone in my religion.  altho you have all qualities im looking for\u000aand i like you hence why i act like an idiot around you and no other males...\u000abut i cant trust ya and the men in my religion they are just different that way.  \u000aif they date a girl, its one girl and its intentions of marriage.  so that eliminates \u000athe stress and questions about .. is he sleeping with other girls, is he wanting more than sex, is he \u000areally interested in long term.  \u000aSo to recap... despite my thinking about you 24-7 and despite my wanting your kids\u000ayou are HIGH RISK&gt; until I know different I quit my job and I will start my life in a different \u000apart of the city and i will make projects up for me so i never think of you. YA RIGHT\u000aill try but i suppose it will just take time.\u000ai dont know why this hurts worse this time?? It means if i let you in AGAIN it will hurt even more the next time... so on.\u000aso i suppose ill lie and say i am gonachange my number from my ex and ill give you my new number .. \u000aand i just wont.  i will miss you. good bye. please take care of you.

V\u000ajealousy is a crazy thing huh? i would aspire to be a better person so you are not so overcome that you do disgusting shameful mean nasty vulgar things like this. that is how you will get ahead in this world. karma is a real bitch. i bet you felt so inadecequate, as you betrayed your friend, and pretended to be me online. what an impressive person you are? i would be soooo proud to be you if i were you. everyone should aspire to be like aysha and tanya the 2 people with all these #awesomepeopleproblems too cool for school, so cool, they 2 face friends, and in turn took that info and passed it along to others, and then, because you are such a stellar wonderful person that we should all look up to, you created an account on CL and pretended to be me, wow tanya you are just really amazing, aysha, way to go, with those #awesomepeopleproblems\u000a\u000aAND since you ladies are just so #awsome with all your #peopleproblems you had enough time on your hands to pretend to be me on the internets, and you ladies are just so freaking rad you had enough time to send me fake emails all night long any number of times, as a different person. man, i really admire you guys. i could have never thought of something so freaking cool. oh no, i just built my own electric scooter, i could never ever ever think of this, i admire your intelligence and coolness since you have such little time on your hands being so cool for us all. \u000a\u000ayou two are SO successful too! and all the girls want you because you are sooo hot, LOL.\u000a\u000agosh, if my crazy ass could only JUST BE LIKE YOU AyshA AND TANYA. I WOULD BE SUCH A COOL HIP PERSON. and you are so awesome you don't have time to walk past my place, oh no everyone in the city wants to be around you 2, you are the definition of what everyone in SF aspires to be. gosh, how can i possibly be graced with your presence in this bar you ladies worked at for such a long time, being cool for all the new lesbians, by doing things like the above. 'this how we do' tanya says as she sips her 40 and lets out ANOTHER wet fart, as aysha scratches her crusty ass and flakes fly.\u000ai am just so taken back by how cool you two are, geez if i could only be like you. \u000a\u000athis is how you treat your 'friends' of HOW MANY YEARS? what do you girls do to your enemies?\u000a\u000alet me give you a glimpse of ayshas personality, if it were someone she was kissing ass to in whatever scene she is adapting her non existent personality to, she would not do it to them, it might tarnish her imagined reputation. but to a friend, of over 5 years she is ready to go. what a nasty nasty girl who would want you aysha? nobody. \u000a\u000ayou are really gross people. i feel very sorry for you. i would never ever ever do that to someone, not something like this. i hate you for it.\u000a

V\u000aIt was around 8:20pm this evening, at the Yerba Buena Gardens, and you asked me if you could buy one of my cigarettes(for all the ridiculous change in your pocket). Little did you know, that you caught my eye the second you walked into my peripheral vision, before laying down on the stage in front of me and staring at the stars. I found you to be intriguing from afar, and I was hooked as soon as I heard your French accent and saw that slight smile.  We were forced to leave the park and split ways, I should have introduced myself, or maybe lingered a bit longer at the street... We should drink coffee together, and not get harassed by cops if it's possible. \u000aIf you somehow stumbled upon this, respond with the name of the museum you didn't want to rush through that night; so I know it's you.

V\u000awe were in green apple. you had long dark hair and glasses, I was making a snide remark to a friend of mine about how 1984 really should have been remade into a romantic comedy by now, and you interjected perhaps it has been, and we're simply too immersed in the modern day fuckery of civilization to notice. we ended up talking first about what we'd do in a Road Warrior-esque american apocalypse, and then about what we ACTUALLY did. you were a programmer, of course, and I am a deadbeat essayist. you asked if you could read some of my work, and I said sure. \u000a\u000awhen I wrote down your email I didn't figure for the rain. the cursed rain. the note in my pocket ran like a cheap metaphor and I thought "dammit, now what to do". my options were to hire a private investigator (expensive), wander around green apple (I already do that), or write a craigslist missed connection (which seems appropriately cliche). I say to myself, what's to become of this; missed connections is about as effective as firing a shotgun into a crowd of pigeons and hoping you get some KFC out of it, and often gawked by people looking for the clown shoes train wrecks of loneliness that naturally inhabit any large city. perhaps you won't read this, sardonic girl, but perhaps someone else will. perhaps Big Brother's sexy sibling, Mistress Observation. on second thought, that sounds like some sort of BDSM thing, and that's not my cup of joseph. \u000a\u000aanyway, needless tangential meanderings aside, it would be nice to talk to you again. even if most likely the only respondants to this will be porn spam offering to engorge my member. everyone's member needs a little engorgement every now and again. \u000a\u000asigned, \u000aOne Trick Pony
