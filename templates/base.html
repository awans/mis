To a Passer-By

The street about me roared with a deafening sound. 
Tall, slender, in heavy mourning, majestic grief, 
A woman passed, with a glittering hand 
Raising, swinging the hem and flounces of her skirt;

Agile and graceful, her leg was like a statue's. 
Tense as in a delirium, I drank 
From her eyes, pale sky where tempests germinate, 
The sweetness that enthralls and the pleasure that kills.

A lightning flash... then night! Fleeting beauty 
By whose glance I was suddenly reborn, 
Will I see you no more before eternity?

Elsewhere, far, far from here! too late! never perhaps!
For I know not where you fled, you know not where I go,
O you whom I would have loved, O you who knew it!

â€” William Aggeler, The Flowers of Evil (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)
