<p>with love from San Francisco</p>
<pre>
	To a Passer-By
	
	The street about me roared with a deafening sound. 
	Tall, slender, in heavy mourning, majestic grief, 
	A woman passed, with a glittering hand 
	Raising, swinging the hem and flounces of her skirt;
	
	Agile and graceful, her leg was like a statue's. 
	Tense as in a delirium, I drank 
	From her eyes, pale sky where tempests germinate, 
	The sweetness that enthralls and the pleasure that kills.
	
	A lightning flash... then night! Fleeting beauty 
	By whose glance I was suddenly reborn, 
	Will I see you no more before eternity?
	
	Elsewhere, far, far from here! too late! never perhaps!
	For I know not where you fled, you know not where I go,
	O you whom I would have loved, O you who knew it!
	
	â€” William Aggeler, The Flowers of Evil (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)
